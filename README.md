# Move-stdlib for Pallet Move

This repository is part of [pallet-move], which enables users to write smart contracts in Substrate-based blockchains with the Move language.
This standard library can be included to provide elementary Move functions in Move smart contracts.
To provide elementary pure Substrate functions, have a look at the [substrate-stdlib].

Currently, it contains the module:
- **ascii**
- **bcs**
- **bit_vector**
- **error**
- **fixed_point32**
- **hash**
- **option**
- **signer**
- **string**
- **type_name**
- **unit_test**
- **vector**
- **acl**
